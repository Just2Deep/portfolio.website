        <p>Emergence of coronavirus in December 2019 and its spread across the world in the following months made it a global health concern. The uncertainty about its evolution, transmission and effect of SARS-CoV-2, has left the countries and their governments in a worrisome state. Ambiguity about the strategies that would work towards mitigating the impact of virus has prompted them to use data-driven methods</p>

    <p>Death Percentage : Even though the percentage of death is 1.17%, it has caused death to more than 6.2 million people. Which is a high number compared to other causes of death.</p>

    <p>Infection by continent: If you look at the column chart for infection rates across different continent. you can see that Europe is leading with highest positive cases, whereas North America and Asia follow on with slightly lesser count and South America has a count closer to Asia but comparatively lower. where as Africa has managed to keep the infection rates low along with Australia and Oceania.</p>

    <p>If you look at the percent population affected across different countries: United Kingdom is leading the chart followed closely by Germany. United States is a distinct third</p>
    <p>Since the total of population of India and China are very high, their percent population affected is low.</p>

    <p>The visualisation in the map beautifully depicts the countries with higher infection rate using a darker shade, which gives us a visual image for the infection percentage in each country.</p>
